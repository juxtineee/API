#Brief description of API

##API

An API, or application programming interface, is a collection of rules that allows various apps to communicate with one another. It serves as an intermediary layer for data transfers across systems, allowing businesses to provide their application data and functionality to third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments inside their organisations.Â An API's definitions and protocols assist businesses in connecting the many various applications they use in day-to-day operations, saving employees time and breaking down walls that impede cooperation and creativity. API documentation serves as an interface for communication between programmes, making application integration easier.
